# SeedVault.L-GPT and project (working) codename a.k.a 'Project FireSeed' (draft & living document)
(project founded and commenced on Friday January 19, 2024)

**"A rose üåπ by any other name..."**

This project's GitHub repository gets its name, along with the initiative's working codename 
(Project FireSeed) and purpose, and is contextualised and informed by: 'Seed Vault' and 
associated and nested systems and technologies, along with general and specific prepping 
technologies, processes and systems. The project's repository and codename are informed by:

**first**, resilient, adaptive and archivable food-system seed vault processes, protocols and 
technologies; and **secondly**, by possibly the first human technology that ever developed, the 
adaptation to, and harnessing of: the boon/bane of fire. üî• Both 'seed' and 'fire' are potent and 
primal metaphors that are pervasive throughout the human condition, and fundamental to human 
culture and its continuity.

# Seed 

I am principally learning *NIX shell üêö scripting, Python üêç programming and website codification,
to develop **this** project, which is a free and open source, local GPT and associated toolkit and 
auditing sustem, that functions as a knowledge 'seed vault' to kick-start humanity's regeneration, 
thriving and community development and capacity, in the eventuation of a cataclysm or apocalypse, 
possibly as a result of rogue AI technology, or somesuch. So essentially, by metaphorical 
extension from 'seed' and 'fire', it is a pragmatic, practical and functional set of protocols, 
tools and processesto empower humans with associated technological automation, to realise the 
project's and programme's digital and non-digital objectives. 

# Roots ü´ö

I envision this repository to house an actionable script (or suite of scripts), along with all 
the necessary information and processes and workflows, nested and embedded in an interactive and 
user-friendly, graphical and portable, user interface (GUI) environment, along with the markdown
of the project's website, graciously hosted by GitHub and Microsoft. The website should seek to 
showcase all aspects of the project, its timeline and development, and seek to draw active skilled
and/or interested and passionate parties to the project.

I hope that the prototyping and functionality of this project will subsequently be optimised for 
diverse systems and purposes, in manifold emergent and tangential projects and initiatives.

I feel that this is the most appropriate metaphorical section in our archetypal vertiginous and 
fecund project outline, to list the required skills (from a rudimentary or skill audit), to 
realise a working prototype:

Our **SeedVault.L-GPT** / **Project FireSeed**, is an ambitious and innovative initiative, that 
aims to create localised, portable and decentralised GPT, associated toolkit and auditing system, 
that functions as an interrogable and actionable knowledge 'seed vault' repository, with 
concomitant and associated technology and information, for humanity in case of a  cataclysm or 
apocalypse. It is initially inspired by b9Joker108‚Äôs lived experience of the world and resultant 
worldview, as well as initially informed by a YouTube video (embedded herewith) that showcases the 
rudimentary process and framework, of how to capture, store and secure the fundamental aspects of
human knowledge in an intelligent and interrogable system, that is localised, decentralised, 
portable and founded upon free and open-source, large language models (LLMs). I intuit that 
liaising with the resplendent **Anna's Archive**, to amass a targeted dataset for the training 
and tuning of the prospective LLMs, will be an imperative. As LLMs are developing and iterating 
with breakneck speed, it is vital that within the project's auspices, that a process is automated,
as much as is pragmatic and save to implement, by hard-wiring and soft-coding systems, that seeks 
to ensure that the LLMs that are selected, remain relevant and appropriate given development, and 
changing technologies and circumstances. This should be auditable and for the 
most part, automatable, but must be checked, assessed and benchmarked by a centralised and de-
centralised committee of informed and empassioned individuals.

Based on a rudimentary project analysis, the following skill areas have been identified in a 
generalised project skills' audit, to realise a working project prototype and bring it to fruition:

- **Shell scripting and Python programming:** These are the core skills that you will need to
  create the scripts and the graphical user interface (GUI) for your project. You will also need
  to be familiar with the LLM framework that you choose to use, such as GPT-3, GPT-Neo, or GPT-J.
  You will need to know how to download, install, run, and update the LLM on your local drive, as
  well as how to interact with it using LM Studio or other tools. You will also need to know how
  to automate the processes and handle any errors or exceptions that may occur.
  
- **Data science and machine learning:** These are the skills that you will need to understand the
  underlying principles and mechanisms of the LLM, as well as how to fine-tune it for your
  specific needs and goals. You will need to know how to preprocess, analyse, and visualise the
  data that you feed to the LLM, as well as how to evaluate its performance and quality. You will
  also need to know how to generate various types of text formats using the LLM, such as
  summaries, instructions, how-to-do guides, teaching stories, inspiring poems and songs, etc., to
  seed cultural reflowering.
  
- **Information security and cryptography:** These are the skills that you will need to ensure the
  safety and integrity of your data and your LLM. You will need to know how to encrypt, decrypt,
  and authenticate your data and your LLM, as well as how to protect them from unauthorized
  access, modification, or deletion. You will also need to know how to backup and restore your
  data and your LLM in case of emergencies, as well as how to detect and prevent any potential
  threats or attacks.
  
- **Project management, storytelling and communication:** These are the skills that you will need
  to plan, execute, monitor, and control your project, as well as to communicate effectively with
  your stakeholders, collaborators, and users. You will need to know how to define the scope,
  objectives, deliverables, and milestones of your project, as well as how to allocate the
  resources, time, and budget. You will also need to know how to manage the risks, issues, and
  changes that may arise during the project lifecycle, as well as how to report the progress and
  outcomes of your project. You will also need to know how to document your project and your LLM,
  as well as how to provide user support and feedback.
  
- **Digital prepping:** This is the skill of creating, storing, and accessing a digital library
  of useful information and resources that can be used offline or in a grid-down situation. You
  will need to know how to:

    - Choose and download an open-source large language model (LLM) that can provide you with
      answers, instructions, and creative content, such as GPT-3, GPT-Neo, or GPT-J.
    - Install and run the LLM on a local drive, such as an external hard drive or a solid state
      drive, using a graphical user interface (GUI) such as LM Studio.
    - Power and maintain your computer and drive using a battery backup, a solar panel, or other
      alternative sources.
    - Encrypt, backup, and restore your data and LLM, as well as protect them from unauthorized
      access, modification, or deletion.
    - Download and store other sources of free knowledge, such as Wikipedia, Khan Academy,
      OpenStreetMap, E-Books, and others, using tools such as Internet-in-a-Box.
    - Organize, search, and update your digital library, as well as share it with others in your
      network or community.

- **General prepping:** This is the skill of planning, preparing, and surviving for various
  emergencies, disasters, and crises that may affect you, your family, or your community. You will
  need to know how to:

    - Build a solid personal finance and health foundation, such as saving money, paying off
      debts, getting insurance, staying fit, and having a regular check-up.
    - Get your home ready for two weeks of self-reliance, such as storing water, food, medicine,
      and other essentials, as well as having a fire extinguisher, a first aid kit, and a
      communication device.
    - Be able to leave your home with only a moment's notice, such as having a bug out bag, a
      vehicle, a destination, and a route.
    - Prepare for emergencies that happen away from home, such as having a get home bag, an
      everyday carry kit, and a survival mindset.
    - Learn core skills and practice with your gear, such as fire making, water purification,
      shelter building, navigation, self-defense, and first aid.
    - Share and recruit while continuing to learn and going beyond the basics, such as joining a
      prepper group, taking advanced courses, reading books, and watching videos.

Just as the project requires a skill audit of fundamental and necessary skills required to realise
it, so too, all those who join the project, should similarly undergo the process of a skills 
audit. There should be some way to securely house and locally store and locate, this information 
and process it into a secure database, that is interrogable and reportable, to inform the
membership of project working groups. Skills are only one aspect of generating efficient and 
inspired project working groups, its compliment is passion or interest,mwhich may or may not be 
so-skilled, but which should be encouraged, included, cherished and actively and demonstratively 
cultivated. Such is the lifeblood, the veritable sap, of any human project or activity.

# Sprout

I anticipate this project, to map, coordinate and programme, the digital and non-digital aspects, 
dubsuming the planning for contingencies and sundry eventualities, in order to realise the project,
as well as keeping the localised project and 
initiative, audited and up-to-date, according to best practices. This is ambitious and currently, 
significantly beyond my propensity and skill level, but realising it will frame and inform my 
learning and practical endeavours.

# Branching

I have been contemplating this project or its likes, and the need for it, since the emergence of 
the generative artificial intelligence GPT boom that began globally in 2023. This boom is both a 
boon and bane, as is AI technology. All my human lived experience informs me, that using AI 
technology, to counter the possible negative impacts of AI technology is fundamental, necessary and
primary. This project is initially informed by:

[![Video thumbnail](https://img.youtube.com/vi/GOjuuw8AvBc/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/GOjuuw8AvBc?si=SB3sv5_74BNfXdJj)

This YouTube video provides a tutorial on how to store and secure the entirety of human knowledge
in your own home. The speaker suggests downloading an open-source large language model (LLM) and 
storing it on a local drive. Here are the steps outlined in the video on how to achieve this:

1. **Choose an LLM:** The speaker recommends choosing the latest and greatest model that your
   computer can run. He suggests downloading an uncensored model, especially for emergency
   situations where you might need to access information that is typically restricted.

2. **Download and store the LLM:** You can download the LLM directly from LM Studio, which is a
   graphical user interface that simplifies the process. LM Studio also tells you which models are
   compatible with your computer. Store the downloaded model on an external drive for redundancy
   and portability.

3. **Run the LLM:** LM Studio provides a chat interface where you can interact with the downloaded
   model. You can ask it questions, get instructions, and even generate creative text formats.

4. **Hardware and power:** To run the LLM, you will need a computer, an external drive to store the
   model, and a power source. The speaker suggests using a battery backup or a solar panel for
   power in case of emergencies.

5. **Maintenance:** Keep your software and models up to date. Regularly check the battery health of
   your backup power source.

The following are some additional points mentioned in the video:

* The speaker acknowledges that storing an LLM locally is not a foolproof solution, but it can be a
  valuable resource in case of internet outages, government restrictions, or other unforeseen
  circumstances.
* They suggest storing the LLM in a fireproof safe and protecting it from electromagnetic
  interference using a Faraday bag.
* The video mentions alternative storage options like solid-state drives, tapes, and Blu-ray discs,
  each with its own advantages and disadvantages. I intuit that none of these storage solutions
  are omptimal for this project, and this will take considerable, informed research and inquiry to
  determine for probity.

Overall, this video provides a comprehensive overview of how to store and access a vast amount of 
information locally using an LLM. While it's important to remember that this is not a guaranteed 
solution for every scenario, it can be a valuable tool for preparedness and knowledge preservation.

competitions, join the discussions, and embark on your data science adventure!

I fortuitously happenned upon Kaggle, by the grace and benevolence of Goddess Serendipity. I 
almost didn't click on the linkage due to being somewhat bemused by its fluffy nomenclature. I 
dont know what repaired my reservations in the name exactly, for I did go forth, through the 
linkage to the site, and was instantaneously pleased, appreciative, and perceived its value to my 
emergent project.

# Seed gathering

In the metaphorical structure of this project and programme's outline, I feel and intuit, that 
this section is apt for enshrining the developmental community aspects and skill requirements to
realise a working prototype of this initiative. It is my experience, that projects and initiatives 
engender their own lifeforce, humunculi of sorts, that bring about the mechanisms and processes 
for their own realisation, and completion. I appreciate that this is rather whimsical and 
fancifil, but this is my experience and it is informed and contextualised by my experience and 
worldview. To this end, I envision that this project will draw to it, people with the necessary
skill-sets, to bring a prototype to fruition.
