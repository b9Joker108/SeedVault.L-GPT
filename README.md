# SeedVault.L-GPT

"A rose by any other name..."

This project's GitHub repository gets its name, and its project's name and purpose, is informed 
and contextualisedby 'Seed Vault' technologies, processes and systems.

# Seed

I am principally learning *NIX shell scripting and Python programming to develop this project, 
which is a free and open source, local GPT and associated toolkit and auditing sustem, that 
functions as a knowledge 'seed vault' to kick-start humanity's regeneration, thriving and community 
development and capacity, in the eventuation of a cataclysm or apocalypse, possibly as a result of 
rogue AI technology. So essentially, by metaphorical extension, it is a pragmatic and functional 
set of protocols, with associated automation, to realise the project's and programme's digital and 
non-digital objectives. 

# Roots

I envision this repository to house an actionable script (or suite of scripts), nested and embedded
in an interactive and user-friendly, graphical user interface (GUI) environment. I hope that the 
prototyping and functionality of this project will subsequently be optimised for diverse systems 
and purposes.

I feel that this is the most appropriate metaphorical section, to list the required skills, to 
realise a working prototype.

# Sprout

I anticipate this project, to map, coordinate and programme, the digital and non-digital aspects, 
dubsuming the planning for contingencies and sundry eventualities, in order to realise the project,
as well as keeping the localised project and 
initiative, audited and up-to-date, according to best practices. This is ambitious and currently, 
significantly beyond my propensity and skill level, but realising it will frame and inform my 
learning and practical endeavours.

# Branching

I have been contemplating this project or its likes, and the need for it, since the emergence of 
the generative artificial intelligence GPT boom that began globally in 2023. This boom is both a 
boon and bane, as is AI technology. All my human lived experience informs me, that using AI 
technology, to counter the possible negative impacts of AI technology is fundamental, necessary and
primary. This project is initially informed by:

This YouTube video provides a tutorial on how to store and secure the entirety of human knowledge
in your own home. The speaker suggests downloading an open-source large language model (LLM) and 
storing it on a local drive. Here are the steps outlined in the video on how to achieve this:

1. **Choose an LLM:** The speaker recommends choosing the latest and greatest model that your
   computer can run. He suggests downloading an uncensored model, especially for emergency
   situations where you might need to access information that is typically restricted.

2. **Download and store the LLM:** You can download the LLM directly from LM Studio, which is a
   graphical user interface that simplifies the process. LM Studio also tells you which models are
   compatible with your computer. Store the downloaded model on an external drive for redundancy
   and portability.

3. **Run the LLM:** LM Studio provides a chat interface where you can interact with the downloaded
   model. You can ask it questions, get instructions, and even generate creative text formats.

4. **Hardware and power:** To run the LLM, you will need a computer, an external drive to store the
   model, and a power source. The speaker suggests using a battery backup or a solar panel for
   power in case of emergencies.

5. **Maintenance:** Keep your software and models up to date. Regularly check the battery health of
   your backup power source.

The following are some additional points mentioned in the video:

* The speaker acknowledges that storing an LLM locally is not a foolproof solution, but it can be a
  valuable resource in case of internet outages, government restrictions, or other unforeseen
  circumstances.
* They suggest storing the LLM in a fireproof safe and protecting it from electromagnetic
  interference using a Faraday bag.
* The video mentions alternative storage options like solid-state drives, tapes, and Blu-ray discs,
  each with its own advantages and disadvantages. I intuit that none of these storage solutions
  are omptimal for this project, and this will take considerable, informed research and inquiry to
  determine for probity.

Overall, this video provides a comprehensive overview of how to store and access a vast amount of 
information locally using an LLM. While it's important to remember that this is not a guaranteed 
solution for every scenario, it can be a valuable tool for preparedness and knowledge preservation.

In the metaphorical structure of this project and programme's outline, I feel and intuit, that 
this section is apt for enshrining the developmental community aspects and skill requirements to
realise a working prototype of this initiative. It is my experience, that projects and initiatives 
engender their own lifeforce, humunculi of sorts, that bring about the mechanisms and processes 
for their own realisation, and completion. I appreciate that this is rather whimsical and 
fancifil, but this is my experience and it is informed and contextualised by my experience and 
worldview. To this end, I envision that this project will draw to it, people with the necessary
skill-sets, to bring a prototype to fruition.
