I understand that once the dataset is prepared in a suitable format for readability by the LLM, 
that it is then enriched bt 'tagging'. Please explain this in detail.

The process of enriching a dataset for Large Language Model (LLM) training and tuning often 
involves "tagging," which is the annotation of the dataset with specific labels or tags to make it 
more informative and tailored to the desired task. This annotation process is crucial for fine-
tuning LLMs to perform specialized tasks with high accuracy.

The tagging process typically involves the following steps:

1. **Data Annotation:** This step involves adding specific tags or labels to the dataset to make it
more relevant to the target task. For example, in the context of natural language processing, this 
could involve labeling text data with categories, entities, or other linguistic features[1][2].

2. **Fine-Tuning the LLM:** Once the dataset is annotated with tags, it is used to fine-tune the 
LLM. During this process, the LLM is trained on the annotated dataset specific to the task, and its 
parameters are updated through iterations of forward and backward propagation, optimizing the model
to better understand and generate predictions for the specific task[1][4].

3. **Enhancing LLM Capabilities:** The annotation and fine-tuning process helps enhance the LLM's 
capabilities in understanding and responding to different language tasks, ultimately improving its 
overall performance, correctness, and practicality[2].

The tagging process is essential for customizing LLMs to meet the particular needs of various 
applications, as it allows the model to adapt to specific tasks with high accuracy. Additionally, 
the use of tags and labels in the training data is crucial for improving the LLM's ability to 
generalize to unseen data and perform effectively across various domains and applications[5].
